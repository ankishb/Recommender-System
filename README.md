# Recommender-System
This is highly involved project on recommendation system with classical and advance method. 


# Project timeline

1.   At Ist stage, we will discuss basics of recommender system and run algorithms on Movie Lens Dataset. Time period of this notebook will be `5` days
2.   At second stage we will extend the same idea to text based recommendation system where we will explore feature extraction for text such as `tf-idf, word-embedding, sent2vec` etc. This will be a heavy deep learning based system. It will be of `7` days time period.
3.   At third stage, we will explore some of the practical aspect of recommender system such as **evaluation metrics**, **cross-validation** etc. Then we will make a hybrid system. This type of models are used in real world application such as netflix, instagram, facebook, amazon etc. It won't be of the same level , but it will provide their essence at brief. It will take around `2` weeks.
4.   At final stage, we will explore`graph neural network` for this domain. We will run experiments on building a good and advance features for recommender system. Time period for this stage will be decided later.
